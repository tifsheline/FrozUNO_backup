# FrozUNO

## Javascript Based Children's Card Game

Game Setup:  FrozUNO is an interactive game for kids, ages 3 and up.  Through Disney's Frozen-themed game, children learn about colors, numbers, and word association.  You can play with up to 4 players per game.  Each player starts with seven cards.  The rest of the cards are placed in the Draw Pile face down.  Next to the Draw Pile is a space designated for the Discard Pile.  With one click, a card is placed in the Discard Pile and the game begins. 

Game Play:  Each player tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.  You have to match by either the number, color, or the symbol/Action.  For example, if the Discard Pile has a blue card that is an 3, you have to either place a blue card or a card with the number 3 on it in the Discard Pile.  You can also play a Wild card (which can change the current color in play).  If the player has no matches or chooses not to play any of their cards even though they have a match, they must draw a card from the Draw Pile.  The player must play one card each round.  The game continues until a player has one card left.  The moment a player has one card left the game will alert that someone has FrozUNO.  The player who is the first to have no cards left wins the game.

## Development Process

Techonologies Used: HTML / CSS / Javascript + Jquery

By creating objects in Javascript and Jquery, the game is able to generate a new game of randomly selected cards by simply clicking Start New Game or Reset Game.  Other objects created using Jquery allows the user to generate a profile so the player does not have to enter their name and age more than once.

CSS + Jquery allow for a smooth transition of the cards animation.  

## Not-Yet-Implemented

* Sound FX
* Detailed graphic design
* Increasing difficulty as player progresses
* Built in theme choices
